# 🛍️ Shopping Trend Analysis using Python & Visualization Tools

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze shopping trends using real-world or simulated customer transaction data. We use Python for data processing, statistical analysis, and generate visual insights using powerful libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The project helps identify key trends in customer behavior, seasonal buying patterns, product popularity, and more.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – Statistical visualizations
- **Plotly** – Interactive visualizations
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development
- *(Optional)* **Power BI / Tableau** – For external business dashboard reports
